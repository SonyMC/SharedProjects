Adding Context With Embedding Techniques 
-----------------------------------------


Project Setup:
--------------
Deprecation warnings about Langchain 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 should be ignored as we are not using these versions!

Python Version
First, you must have the 3.11 version of Python installed:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

This is very important, as only a few versions of Python support LangChain and OpenAI.

Pipenv Installation and Configuration
1. If you have not already done so, create a facts directory somewhere on your development machine.
2. If you have not already installed Pipenv from the previous section, you must do that now. In your terminal run pip install pipenv or depending on your environment, pip3 install pipenv

3. Create a file in your facts project directory called Pipfile

4. Copy paste the following code into that new Pipfile (or drag and drop the file that is attached to this lecture into your facts project directory):



[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"
 
[packages]
langchain = "==0.0.352"
openai = "==0.27.8"
python-dotenv = "==1.0.0"
tiktoken = "*"
chromadb = "*"
 
[dev-packages]
 
[requires]
python_version = "3.11"


5. Inside your facts project directory, run the following command to install your dependencies from the Pipfile:

pipenv install

6. Run the following command to create and enter a new environment:

pipenv shell

After doing this your terminal will now be running commands in this new environment managed by Pipenv.

Once inside this shell, you can run Python commands just as shown in the lecture videos.

eg:

python main.py

7. If you make any changes to your environment variables or keys, you may find that you need to exit the shell and re-enter using the pipenv shell command.

Important - Anaconda users may find that Pipenv conflicts with their environment. Please deactivate your conda environment if you find this to be true.

Deprecation warnings about Langchain 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 should be ignored as we are not using these versions!

Project:
---------
facts
\Project\facts

.env
Pipfile
facts.txt
facts.txt
main
main.py


Run pgm:
Open VS terminal :
    cmd: cd D:\Project\facts
    cmd: pipenv shell
    cmd: pipenv install
    
    cmd: pip install --upgrade langchain langchain_community
        - Note: the above cmd is only for Windows user as else it will show a pwd module error:
        - The error occurs because the pwd module is specific to Unix-based systems (like Linux or macOS) and is not available on Windows. This issue arises from a dependency in the langchain_community package.

    cmd: python main.py



    - Output:
        - Will show the OPen AI embeddings for the sample text provided in teh pgm
        - Will split 'facts.txt' into chunks as speciied in pgm and print in console


Open Source 
----------------
Project = facts_open_source
\Project\facts_open_source


main.py:

    - Note: uses sentence-transformers which uses your local computer resources rather than OpenAI

Run pgm:
Open VS terminal :
    cmd: \Project\facts_open_source
    cmd: pipenv shell
    cmd: pipenv install
    
    cmd: pip install --upgrade langchain langchain_community
        - Note: the above cmd is only for Windows user as else it will show a pwd module error:
        - The error occurs because the pwd module is specific to Unix-based systems (like Linux or macOS) and is not available on Windows. This issue arises from a dependency in the langchain_community package.

    cmd: pip install hf_xet
    cmd: pip install sentence-transformers
    cmd: pip install langchain-huggingface

    cmd: python main.py



    - Output:
        - Will show the OPen AI embeddings for the sample text provided in the pgm
        - Will split 'facts.txt' into chunks as specified in pgm and print in console
