Creating an OpenAI API Key
Hi! This document shows how to create an API key with OpenAI. This API key is required to access ChatGPT programmatically.

IMPORTANT PLEASE READ

The OpenAI API doesn't have a free tier. As of summer 2024, they no longer offer free credits to new user accounts. You must add a credit card and load a balance of $5 USD (or whatever your regional equivalent is). Otherwise, you will get persistent rate limit errors when running the project code.

Some students have asked if they can just use a different LLM such as Gemini or LLama, etc. This is explicitly a ChatGPT with LangChain course (using Python). You are more than welcome to try and replace ChatGPT, however, we are not able to provide support for any of these changes. The code and projects were not tested using any other LLMs, so, you will likely find that many things may not work as shown.

Obtaining API Key
1. Open your browser and navigate to https://platform.openai.com/

2. Create an OpenAI account by logging in with an existing provider or by creating an account with your email address.

3. On the top right-hand side, click 'Personal' then 'View API Keys'

4. Click the 'Create new secret key' button

5. Enter a name of 'PyCode' then click 'Create Secret Key'

6. Copy the key that gets generated, we will use it in the next lecture. Don't close this window until you use the key!
